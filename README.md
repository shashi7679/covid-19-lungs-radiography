## Roadmap

- Currently Solving the problem of class imbalance.

- Trying to come up with a model that could perform well on a singleton input. 


## Optimizations

- Tried Learning Rate decay, but it didn't help.
- Tried to tune Learning rate with Adam Optimizer, but still no effective performance gain.
- Trying try some other architecture, such as AutoEncoder.
